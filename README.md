yajsync
=======

yajsync is a port of [rsync](http://rsync.samba.org) written in Java.

yajsync currently supports a minimal subset of rsync protocol version
30.0.

Currently implemented rsync options:

- Incremental recursion (-r, --recursive)

- Preserve owner (-o, --owner)

- Preserve permissions (-p, --perms)

- Preserve times (-t, --times)

- Transfer directories (-d, --dirs)

- Don't skip files that match size and time (-I, --ignore-times)

- Read daemon-access password from FILE (--password-file=FILE) or environment variable RSYNC_PASSWORD

- Module file listings

yajsync is compliant with at least rsync version 3.0.9.


Features
--------

- rsync Java API

- Platform independent rsync server

- Platform independent rsync client with support for both local and
  remote file transfers

- Native SSL/TLS tunneling

Please be aware though that the API currently is unstable, not
documented and will most probably change in the near future.


Warning
-------

This software is still unstable and there might be data corruption
bugs hiding. So use it only carefully at your own risk.

If you encounter any problems please create an issue with

Example
-------

Start a Server listening on localhost port 14415, with one implicitly
read-only module called Downloads and one readable and writable module
called Uploads:

```
$ cat yajsyncd.conf

# This line and all text after a `#' is a comment. Text within square
# brackets define the name of a new module. A module definition may be
# followed by any number of predefined parameter value statements on
# the form key = value. The current available module parameters are:
#
#    path          An existing path to the module (mandatory).
#    comment       Text that will be shown to the client in module listings
#                  (optional).
#    is_readable   A boolean (true or false) indicating whether files
#                  may be read below this module (optional, default is
#                  true).
#    is_writable   A boolean (true or false) indicating whether files
#                  may be written below this module (optional, default
#                  is false).

# This is a module definition for a module called Downloads. path is
# the only mandatory module parameter. This one also provides a
# comment. All modules are implicitly readable but not writable:
[Downloads]
path = /path/to/Downloads/
comment = this text will be printed on module listings, it is optional
# is_readable = true
# is_writable = false

# Uploads is both readable and writable; it does not provide a
# comment:
[Uploads]
path = /path/to/Uploads/
is_writable = true
```

Start the server:
```
$ java -Dumask=$(umask) -jar build/jar/yajsyncd.jar --port=14415 --config=yajsyncd.conf
```

Recursively upload the directory called example to Uploads:
```
java -Dumask=$(umask) -jar build/jar/yajsync.jar --port=14415 -r example localhost::Uploads
```

The same thing using the alternative syntax:
```
java -Dumask=$(umask) -jar build/jar/yajsync.jar -r example rsync://localhost:14415/Uploads
```

And finally the same thing using the original rsync client:
```
rsync --port=14415 -r example localhost::Uploads
```


Note
----

- Recursive transfers always implies incremental recursion.

- Use ```--charset``` for setting common character set (defaults to
  UTF-8). Note that ```--iconv``` is _not_ supported.

- Client local file transfers always uses rsync:s delta transfer
  algorithm, i.e. it does not have an option ```--whole-file```.

- Checksum block size is not computed in the exact same way as
  rsync. It is computed dynamically based on the file size and is
  always an even multiple of 2 and at least 512 bytes long.

- Wild cards are not supported.


Extra feature
-------------

yajsync also adds the client/server local option ```--defer-write```
which makes the receiver avoid writing into a temporary file if the
target file is unchanged.


Build instructions
------------------

Requirements:

- [git](http://git-scm.com)
- [ant](http://ant.apache.org)
- [OpenJDK 1.7 or later](http://openjdk.java.net/) or [Oracle JDK 7](http://java.oracle.com)

Procedure:

    git clone https://github.com/perlundq/yajsync.git
    cd yajsync
    ant


Usage
-----

Show client/server help (-h argument):

(Windows):

    java -jar build/jar/yajsync.jar  -h
    java -jar build/jar/yajsyncd.jar -h

(Unix/Linux, we must inject necessary umask information as a property,
assuming Bourne shell compatible syntax)

    java -Dumask=$(umask) -jar build/jar/yajsync.jar  -h
    java -Dumask=$(umask) -jar build/jar/yajsyncd.jar -h

Recommended extra options to the jvm (i.e. must be placed before the
-jar <jar-file> argument):

Turn on assertions:

    -ea

Use a more memory conservative garbage collector:

    -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC

Turn on aggressive optimisations:

    -XX:+AggressiveOpts

SSL/TLS is configured externally (see JSSE documentation), but the
following properties are used (options to the JVM):

    -Djavax.net.ssl.keyStore=...
    -Djavax.net.ssl.keyStoreAlias=...
    -Djavax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword=...
    -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=...
    -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=...

javax.net.debug is useful for debugging SSL/TLS. To see available
values to javax.net.debug:

    -Djavax.net.debug=help

Note: client side authorisation is not yet implemented - requires
changes to server configuration.
